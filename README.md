# Hyperborg Project

## About

The current home automatization scene has wonderful projects, like Domoticz and Home Assistant. They are nice, powerful and recommended, but they have some design differences permitting them to be fully useful in some scenarios. 

The HyperBorg is a new contender in this area that would like to learn from the mistakes from the big and old ones.

HyperBorg is focusing on security, stability and decentralization, as well as easy-peasy installation and maintenance.

It targets both non-IT users as well as hardcore home automatization people.

Based on Qt Framework, it brings advanced features as well as unique scalability.

Get on board!
